	{"key":"UpdateInfo_1.0.0.0","value":"It's been so long since the last build, in order for me to make the changelog I had to check the previous build to see where we last left off and let me just say WOW, is that really how far behind the previous build was? Am I sure I'm looking at the correct previous build? Version 0.0.4.0 was the last build right? It doesn't even have the basic design for the level I made ages ago! Anyway... Once the testers have a crack at this and we fix the bugs that we feel like fixing :P we will release this sucker :) . Hopefully I manage to list all the changes here now that everything is done... ;)\n - Alastair"},
